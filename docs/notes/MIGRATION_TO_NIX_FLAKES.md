# Migration: Bazel → Nix Flakes 🎉

## Summary

Successfully removed Bazel and migrated to Nix Flakes for a cleaner, more NixOS-native development experience.

---

## What Was Removed ❌

### Bazel Files
- `.bazelversion`
- `.bazelrc`
- `.bazelrc.local`
- `BUILD.bazel` (root)
- `MODULE.bazel`
- `MODULE.bazel.lock`
- `WORKSPACE`
- `backend/BUILD.bazel`
- `scripts/bazel-nix.sh`

### Old Nix
- `shell.nix` (replaced with `flake.nix`)

**Total removed:** ~1000 lines of configuration!

---

## What Was Added ✅

### Nix Flakes
- `flake.nix` (single configuration file)
- `flake.lock` (locked dependencies)

### Task Runner
- `Justfile` (replaces complex build commands)

### Updates
- `.envrc` → changed from `use nix` to `use flake`
- `.gitignore` → updated for Nix

**Total added:** ~300 lines of clean configuration!

---

## Why This Is Better

### 1. **Simpler** 🎯
```bash
# Before (Bazel)
bazel test //backend/cmd/api:api_test

# After (Nix + Just)
just test-backend
```

### 2. **No NixOS Issues** ✅
```bash
# Before: Needed /bin/bash symlink, gcc workarounds
# After: Just works! Native NixOS support
```

### 3. **Automatic Environment** 🚀
```bash
# Before: Manually run nix-shell or fight with Bazel
# After: direnv loads everything automatically on cd
```

### 4. **Cleaner Workflow** 📝
```bash
# See all commands
just

# Run tests
just test

# Start dev environment
just dev
```

### 5. **Better Caching** ⚡
```bash
# Nix caches based on content hash
# Same inputs = instant rebuild
```
